\section{Select Projects And Talks}
\begin{flushleft}
\textbf{STEM Games 2018} \\
Helped organise the 2018 STEM Games held in Poreč, Croatia. Part of the team that organised the Technology Arena, an interactive software engineering competition for students of various backgrounds. I built the competition platform front-end using a modern stack (Vue, Pug, SASS and PhoenixJS), and integrated it with the Elixir/Phoenix back-end.

\halfsectionspacing

\textbf{Madison.hr} \\
Madison is a public relations agency based in Zagreb, Croatia. I was part of the team that built their new website, building the front-end part of a modern Ruby on Rails application which allows the team to perform edits to the site in real-time using an intuitive WYSIWYG approach implemented with Phrasing.

\halfsectionspacing

\textbf{Sumirra} \\
Sumirra was a startup which allowed Croatian students to see an aggregation of their student incomes and their tax obligations, helping them and their parents avoid hefty tax back payments caused by unclear taxation laws. As part of the core team, using Kotlin and Spring, I built the back-end services which scraped and aggregated income data. Sumirra won the 2017 App Start Contest and was a part of SPOCK, a startup incubator. Sumirra gained a lot of support and following, but work was ultimately halted due to a lack of institutional support.

\halfsectionspacing

\textbf{European Universities Games 2016 Mobile Applications} \\
I was part of the team that built the mobile companion apps for the European Universities Games held in Zagreb, Croatia. My responsibilities included architecting, developing and supporting the native Android application written in Kotlin, as well as integrating our back-end solution with the official EUG website.

\halfsectionspacing

\textbf{Tour of Croatia 2016 Mobile Applications} \\
Led the team of 4 that developed the native iOS and Android companion applications for the Tour of Croatia 2016. My responsibilities included designing the API which powered the apps, designing the application flows and architecting and developing the Android application, written in Kotlin.

\halfsectionspacing

\textbf{American Express MyAccount} \\
Led the team of 5 that developed the Android and Windows Phone versions of the MyAccount mobile application using Sencha Touch and Apache Cordova.

\halfsectionspacing

\textbf{The highs and lows of Android app development with Xtend} \\
Held a talk on the first Croatian droidcon (an international conference on Android development) about my experiences with developing Android applications with Xtend - an alternative language for developing on the JVM.
