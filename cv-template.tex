\section{Select Projects And Talks}
\begin{flushleft}

\textbf{STEM Games 2018} \\
Participated in the organisation of the 2018 STEM Games held in Poreč, Croatia. I was part of the team that organised the Technology Arena, an interactive software engineering competition for students of various backgrounds. For the competition platform, I built the front-end using a modern stack based on Vue, Pug, SASS and PhoenixJS, and I integrated the front-end with the Elixir/Phoenix-based back-end.

\halfsectionspacing

\textbf{Myo.de} \\
Myo is an up and coming startup in the elderly care industry. I assisted the Myo team in modernising their back-end stack and migrating their development team from a consulting agency to an in-house team by helping hire an in-house CTO. I also built the basics of their new back-end for their mobile applications, building it with Spring and Kotlin.

\halfsectionspacing

\textbf{Madison.hr} \\
Madison is a public relations agency based in Zagreb, Croatia. I was part of the team that built their new website, building the front-end part of a modern Ruby on Rails application which allows the team to perform edits to the site in real-time using an intuitive WYSIWYG approach implemented with Phrasing.

\halfsectionspacing

\textbf{Sumirra} \\
Sumirra was a startup which allowed Croatian students to see an aggregation of their student incomes and their tax obligations, helping them and their parents avoid hefty tax back payments caused by unclear taxation laws. As part of the core team, using Kotlin and Spring, I built the back-end services which scraped and aggregated income data. Sumirra won the 2017 App Start Contest and was a part of SPOCK, a startup incubator. Sumirra gained a lot of support and following, but work was ultimately halted due to a lack of institutional support.

\halfsectionspacing

\textbf{European Universities Games 2016 Mobile Applications} \\
I was part of the team that built the mobile companion apps for the European Universities Games held in Zagreb, Croatia. My responsibilities included architecting, developing and supporting the native Android application written in Kotlin, as well as integrating our back end solution with the official EUG website.

\halfsectionspacing

\textbf{Tour of Croatia 2016 Mobile Applications} \\
Led the team that developed the native iOS and Android companion applications for the Tour of Croatia 2016. My responsibilities included designing the API which powered the apps, designing the application flows and architecting and developing the Android application, written in Kotlin.

\halfsectionspacing

\textbf{American Express MyAccount} \\
Led the team that developed the Android and Windows Phone versions of the MyAccount mobile application using Sencha Touch and Apache Cordova.

\halfsectionspacing

\textbf{The highs and lows of Android app development with Xtend} \\
Held a talk on the first Croatian droidcon (an international conference on Android development) about my experiences with developing Android applications with Xtend - an alternative language for developing on the JVM.

\end{flushleft}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%% Open source contributions %%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Notable Open Source Contributions}
\begin{flushleft}

\textbf{CyanogenMod 6 - Android gallery} \\
CyanogenMod was the most popular after-market Android-based operating system. During the CyanogenMod 6 days, I submitted patches to the Android gallery app which significantly increased the resolution of the images displayed in the gallery by making better use of available memory. These changes were also featured in an XDA-Developers article.

\halfsectionspacing

\textbf{HbnContainer} \\
HbnContainer is a data connector for Vaadin based on the popular Hibernate ORM. I expanded its functionality by implementing the new Filtering API which enabled its users to perform better sorting and filtering of Hibernate data sets.
